## 🎯 Project Objective
The healthcare sector often struggles with fragmented and inconsistent data, leading to inefficiencies in patient tracking, appointment scheduling, and financial analysis.  
*Care_Stat* addresses this by providing a *centralized, integrated database system* that enhances:
- Operational efficiency
- Quality of healthcare
- Data-driven decision-making
- Financial sustainability

## 🔧 What I Built (End-to-End)

✅ *Designed a complete relational database from scratch*  
- Ensured data integrity and minimized redundancy
- Implemented proper relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
- Normalized schema for scalability and performance

📥 *Collected & cleaned realistic healthcare data*  
- Simulated a real hospital environment:
  - 10,000+ patients
  - 12 medical departments
  - Appointments, visits, medical records, and payments

💾 *Used SQL for database operations*  
- Created tables, constraints, and indexes
- Wrote complex queries for data extraction and analysis

📊 *Advanced Data Analysis with Multiple Tools*  
| Tool       | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|
| *Excel* | Quick filtering, data validation, and preliminary analysis |
| *Python* (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) | Data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization |
| *Power BI* | Interactive dashboard with real-time KPIs for doctors, patients, and finance |

📈 *Extracted Actionable Insights*
- Doctor rating vs. salary correlation
- Payment methods and status analysis (pending, completed, failed, refunded)
- Monthly revenue trends and seasonal patterns
- Department utilization and emergency room capacity
